# 👋 Hey, I'm Sauvik Gon

I'm a Computer Science grad student who’s into **machine learning**, **formal verification**, and building stuff that actually works — from falsifying Cyber-Physical Systems to designing user-centric full-stack apps.

Most of my recent work revolves around decision trees, falsification, and building real-world tools using Flask + Vue + Redis + Celery. If I’m not coding, I’m probably tweaking my simulations in MATLAB or reading research papers on verification.
